## Inroduction
Metaverse is a “shared virtual environment that people access via the Internet”. 
The technology creates a set of virtual spaces where people can immerse themselves through 
holograms/avatars to make it feel like they are in the same physical space. 
However we've build a chat app using `react-js` `next-js` `taiwand-css` and `moralis`. 
Moralis provides us the backend support for storing and retrieving data from blockchain.

## How to run?
Visit `moralis.io` and `create a server`.
Create a `.env.local` file in your project directory at `/project-name/`. And store NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID and NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL, which you will get from morlais server.
Now install all the node dependencies `npm i`
Run `npm run dev` to start the server Then  Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.
